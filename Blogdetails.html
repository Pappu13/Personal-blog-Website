                <!-- Main body of the blog post goes here -->
                <p>Besides the well-touted (and frequently Instagrammed) benefit of adding tone and definition to your muscles, how does strength training help? Here are just a few of the many ways:</p>
                <ol><li><h4> Strength Training Makes You Stronger and Fitter</h4></li>
                <p>This benefit is the obvious one, but it shouldn’t be overlooked. “Muscle strength is crucial in making it easier to do the things you need to do on a day-to-day basis,” Pire says — especially as we get older and naturally start to lose muscle.

                    Strength training is also called resistance training because it involves strengthening and toning your muscles by contracting them against a resisting force. According to the Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine, there are two types of resistance training:
                <ul>
                    <li>Isometric Resistance This involves contracting your muscles against a nonmoving object, such as against the floor in a pushup.</li>
                    <li>Isotonic Strength Training This involves contracting your muscles through a range of motion, as in weight lifting.</li>
                </ul></p>
              
                
                    <li>
                        <h4>Strength Training Protects Bone Health and Muscle Mass</h4></li>
                        <p>At around age 30 we start losing as much as 3 to 5 percent of lean muscle mass per decade thanks to aging, notes Harvard Health Publishing.

                            According to a study from 2017, just 30 minutes twice a week of high-intensity resistance and impact training was shown to improve functional performance, as well as bone density, structure, and strength in postmenopausal women with low bone mass — and it had no negative effects.
                            
                            Likewise, the HHS physical activity guidelines note that, for everyone, muscle-strengthening activities help preserve or increase muscle mass, strength, and power, which are essential for bone, joint, and muscle health as we age.</p>
                    
                
                
                    <li>
                        <h4>Strength Training Helps Your Body Burn Calories Efficiently</h4></li>
                        <p>All exercise helps boost your metabolism (the rate your resting body burns calories throughout the day).

                            With both aerobic activity and strength training, your body continues to burn calories after strength training as it returns to its more restful state (in terms of energy exerted). It’s a process called “excess post-exercise oxygen consumption,” according to the American Council on Exercise (ACE).
                            
                            But when you do strength, weight, or resistance training, your body demands more energy based on how much energy you’re exerting (meaning the tougher you’re working, the more energy is demanded). So you can amplify this effect depending on the amount of energy you put into the workout. That means more calories burned during the workout, and more calories burned after the workout, too, while your body is recovering to a resting state.</p>
                     
                    
                
                
                    <li>
                        <h4>Strength Training Helps Keep the Weight Off for Good</h4></li>
                        <p>Because strength training boosts excess postexercise oxygen consumption more than aerobic exercise, it can also help exercisers boost weight loss more than if you were to just do aerobic exercise alone, Pire says. “[Resistance or strengthening exercise] keeps your metabolism active after exercising much longer than after an aerobic workout.”

                            That’s because lean tissue in general is more active tissue. “If you have more muscle mass, you’ll burn more calories — even in your sleep — than if you didn’t have that extra lean body mass,” he adds.
                            
                            A study published in 2017 found that, compared with dieters who didn’t exercise and those who did only aerobic exercise, dieters who did strength training exercises four times a week for 18 months lost the most fat (about 18 pounds, compared with 10 pounds for nonexercisers and 16 pounds for aerobic exercisers).
                            
                            You may even be able to further reduce body fat specifically when strength training is combined with reducing calories through diet. People who followed a combined full-body resistance training and diet over the course of four months reduced their fat mass while improving lean muscle mass better than either resistance training or dieting alone, concluded a small study published in 2018.</p>

                <p>Looking back on yet another year of navigating life through a pandemic, you might feel as though fitness remained on the back burner or that you generally didn’t get to move as much as you had hoped. But that’s okay—with a new year comes a new chance to hit the reset button and refresh both your wellness goals and how you think about them.

                    Here are eight pieces of expert advice on fitness from our Forbes Health Advisory Board members to help inspire you to get moving in 2024.
                    
                    </p>
                <ol><li><h4>Put in a Daily Effort</h4></li>
                <p> “Exercise is of particular importance as we age,” says Robert Lahita, the director of the Institute for Autoimmune and Rheumatic Disease at St. Joseph’s Health in Paterson, New Jersey. “Remember: It doesn’t mean running marathons or Spartan races. It needs to be a daily effort to work the body in favor of the biological soul—to let go, relax the brain, stress the body in a good way and luxuriate in the flow of hormones, endorphins and cytokines.</p>
             
                
                    <li>
                        <h4>Use the Right Gear</h4>
                        <p>“Many New Year’s resolutions revolve around being more active, and having the right support for that activity can help prevent injuries and keep you on track for your goals,” says Mehgan Susek, a podiatrist and wound care specialist in Pennsylvania. “Make sure to use shoe gear that’s designed for the sport or fitness activity you choose to pursue.”

                            “Check your current shoe gear and make sure to replace shoes or inserts when they show signs of wear or have surpassed the recommended number of hours/miles of use, as shoe gear can wear out and lead to problems,” she adds. “And don’t ignore foot or ankle pain—see your health care provider for any aches or injuries to help avoid further complications.”</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Tune Into Your Motivation</h4>
                        <p>“It’s so easy to come up with reasons not to work out on any given day, but try not to talk yourself out of it,” suggests Rachel Tavel, a doctor of physical therapy and certified strength and conditioning specialist in New York City. “If you need motivation, take a moment to reflect on how you feel physically and mentally after your next workout. Do a ‘before’ and ‘after’ assessment. Capture it in writing. Then, use it as your motivation the next time you’re wavering.”

                            “It’s okay to not feel like exercising, but sometimes, that’s the only time in the day you have,” she adds. “So go. Do it for the version of you waiting on the other side of the workout.”</p>
                        
                     
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Focus on the Feel</h4>
                        <p>“As we start the new year, try focusing on short-term goals of how you want to feel rather than how you want to look,” advises Jaspal Singh, M.D., a triple-board certified physician specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, sports medicine and pain medicine in New York City. “When we focus on only the outward benefits of exercise rather than the health benefits, these goals fall through.”</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Do It for Your Brain Health</h4>
                        <p>“Physical activity that increases your heart rate improves blood flow, and a well-oxygenated brain is a healthy brain,” says Phillip Stieg, M.D., a board-certified neurosurgeon with expertise in cerebrovascular disorders, brain tumors and skull base surgery. “Regular exercise can also help maintain your brain’s volume—it slows down the shrinkage that’s a natural part of aging and increases the size of the hippocampus, which is involved in verbal memory, learning and emotions.”

                            “Exercise has been shown to lower the levels of the stress hormone cortisol—an excess of which speeds up the aging process,” he adds. “Aim for 30 minutes of low-impact activity on most days, with a moderate intensity that gets your heart rate up to 120 beats a minute, adding in stretching and balance routines to stay flexible and steady on your feet.”</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Value Your Time</h4><p>“I talk to patients all day about the importance of exercise, and the most common excuse I get is, ‘I don’t have time’ or, ‘I’m too busy,’” notes Micah Eimer, M.D., an experienced general cardiologist in Illinois. “I pose the following question: ‘What if Steve from accounting randomly wanted to meet with you next Wednesday for 45 minutes?’ Most patients say they would take the meeting. I then point out that they would make time for someone else, but can’t find time for themselves to exercise. Be more judicious with your time—make an appointment with yourself in the same way you’d accept an appointment with Steve.”</p></li>
                    <li><h4>The Movement Matters More Than the Outcome</h4>
                    <p>“I just read this new, fascinating study on how our genes affect our fitness outcomes, and I think that connection can help us all realize that unique gene expression makes us one of a kind, so we shouldn’t get hung up on comparing ourselves to others,” says Sabrena Jo, the senior director of science and research at the American Council on Exercise (ACE). “Regular exercise improves health and fitness, and we don’t have complete control over how our bodies will respond. These findings open us up to enjoying movement more while focusing less on the outcomes.”

                        “Finding ways to incorporate physical activity into your lifestyle, whether it’s in the form of structured exercise or spending less time sitting, should be a function of how well it suits your values and preferences and less about appearance or performance outcomes,” she adds.  “Improved health will result from consistent participation in physical activity, regardless of your genetics.”</p></li>
                    <li><h4>A Short and Sweet Reminder</h4>
                    <p>“The single best thing you can do to improve your health is… drumroll please… exercise,” concludes Jose Antonio, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of the International Society of Sports Nutrition. “And the single best dietary approach to improving your body composition is protein.”</p></li></ol>
